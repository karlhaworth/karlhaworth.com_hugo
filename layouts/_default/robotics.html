      <p>
        As part of their senior project at the Manufacturing Technology Academy,
        Karl Haworth and Jack Kerby-Miller designed and built a robot to compete
        against other schools and tech groups in the heavyweight Sumo Robot
        Competition at the National Robotics Challenge, April 15th - 17th in
        Marion, Ohio. Over a period of seven months, the team followed the Plan
        Do Study Act method for continuous improvement to create their entry.
        They began by understanding the challenges intrinsic to the Sumo Robot
        Competition, specifically, reading the rules and synthesizing personal
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was understood that the robot would need to detect its opponent and
        autonomously move towards it, forcing it out of the large square arena.
        To accomplish this end, the team designed its robot to maximize torque
        and traction. They created a logic system that would use binary distance
        sensors with adjustable ranges to locate and their opponent and move
        towards it. The program was made to adjust the robot's course depending
        on which of the four LED sensors were activated at any one time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to provide the necessary torque and horsepower, the robot was
        given six CIM motors which were each geared down in a 12:1 planetary
        gearbox before they were routed to rubberized tank treads to provide
        superior traction. Two 12 volt Lead-Acid batteries provided the
        necessary power for these motors. Also to improve traction, the robot
        was built to weigh exacly 125 pounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, as a key advantage, hinged aluminum side flaps were attached to
        help lift opponents off the playing surface, reducing the effectiveness
        of their drive mechanisms. After the Robot's completion, the team
        traveled to compete, earning 5 wins and losing to only 1 robot. Some
        design issues were identified in competition and were resolved, but not
        before the team was eliminated. In exhibition matches afterwards, these
        adjustments resulted in victory over the only robot that the team had
        lost to.
